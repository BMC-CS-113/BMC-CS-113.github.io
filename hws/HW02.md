=============================================================

_Due: {{page.due_date}}_

In this assignment you will be working with variables, and reading in user data with the `Scanner` class, and creating `methods`


> Requirements:
> 
> - Use `printf`. You are not allowed to use any other
> method for printing output 
> - Every method you created should be tested in the class's main method.
> - Every java file should have a header. However, ***DO NOT PUT YOUR NAME IN YOUR HEADERS***. On gradescope we grade your assignments anonymously so including your name in your Java file will defeat that purpose. However, please include your name in your README.txt

> Note, in the examples, `*` indicates user input.



## 1. Dates

Write a program called `Dates.java` that will print out dates in different formats. The program should ask the user for the following information:

1. Day of the week, e.g. `Sunday`, `Monday`, ... <i>(e.g. stands for exempli gratia, meaning for example)</i>
2. Month, e.g. `June`, `July`
3. The day of the month, e.g. `10`, `29`, ...
4. The year, e.g. `2023`, `1990`, `1754`

Then create the following two methods:

- `printEuropean`: this prints the information in the European format
- `printAmerican`: this prints the information in the American format.

Both methods should have four paramaters. The order of the parameters should match the order listed above.
 

```
$ javac Dates.java; java Dates
What is a day of the week? *Thursday*
What is the month? *January*
What is the day of the month? *26*
What is the year? *2023*

American format: Thursday, January 26, 2023
European format: Thursday 26 January 2023
```


## 2. Control Flow

For this problem you will walk through the flow of execution of a program with multiple methods. Read the following code and answer the questions in a file called `ControlFlow.txt`. We removed `public static` for stylistic sakes, you can assume every method signature starts with `public static`

```
  1   int leaveHome(int num) {
  2     System.out.printf("%d little ducks went out one day\n", num);
  3     return num - 1;
  4   }
  5 
  6   void whereTheyGo() {
  7     System.out.printf("over the hill and far away,\n");
  8   }
  9
 10   void mommaSay() {
 11     System.out.printf("Momma duck said quak quak quak quak\n");
 12   }
 13 
 14   void comeHome(int returnDucks) {
 15     System.out.printf("but only %d ducks came back", returnDucks);
 16   }
 17 
 18   void whereTheyGo(String terrain) {
 19     System.out.printf("over the %s and far away,\n", terrain);
 20   }
 21 
 22   void jumping(String animal, int num) {
 23     System.out.printf("There were %d %s jumping on the bed", num, animal);
 24   }
 25 
 26   void song(String animal, String place, int num) {
 27     num = leaveHome(num);
 28     whereTheyGo();
 29     mommaSay();
 30     comeHome(num);
 31     num = leaveHome(num);
 32     whereTheyGo(place);
 33     mommaSay();
 34     comeHome(num) // was accidently num = comeHome(num);
 35     jumping(animal, num);
 36     comeHome(num) // was accidently num = comeHome(num);
 37   }
 38
 39   void main() {
 40     song("monkeys", "mountain", 4);
 41   }
 42 
 43   void main(String[] args) {
 44     song("monkeys", "mountain", 4);
 45   }
 46 }
```

1. Write down the line numbers in the order of which they are executed. For example, if java we executed the `foo` method shown below, you would write just 
`71, 72, 73` - you do not need to include the method signature
or the lines with just closing brackets.

	```
 70 void foo() {
 71   int a = 0;
 72   double b = a + 5.0;
 73   return;
 74 }
	```

2. What is the value of the parameter `num` in the `void jumping(String animal, int num)` method the first time that method is called.

3. What is the output of this program.

> Requirement: make to sure to seperate each line number by a comma (,), otherwise our autograder wont work and you will lose points.


## 3. Payments 

BMC needs a program to calculate how much to pay their hourly employees. The US Department of Labor requires that employees get paid time and a half for any hours over 40 that they work in a single week. For example, if an employee works 45 hours, they get 5 hours of overtime, at 1.5 times their base pay. BMC employess are paid at \$15.00 an hour. Employees are not allowed to work more than 60 hours in a week.

### Rules:

- An employee gets paid (hours worked) × (base pay), for each hour up to 40 hours.
- For every hour over 40, they get overtime = (base pay) × 1.5.
- The base pay must not be less than the minimum wage ($15.00 an hour). If it is, print a message. If the number of hours is greater than 60, print an error message.

### Directions

Create a new class called `Payments`.
Write a method called `pay()` that takes the base pay and hours worked as parameters, and prints the total pay or an error. Write a main method that calls this method for each of these employees:

|  	| Base Pay 	| Hours Worked 	|
|---	|---	|---	|
| Employee 1 	| $22.50 	| 48 	|
| Employee 2 	| $14.90 	| 38 	|
| Employee 3 	| $30.92 	| 70 	|
| Employee 4 	| $16.75 	|  29	|



## README.txt

In a text file called `README.txt` answer the following questions:

1. How much time did you spend on the homework
2. What did you learn from this homework
3. optional: What did you struggle with during this homework
4. optional: any other feedback you would like to share

**Dont forget:** make sure to fill in the header in all of your java files.

## Submitting

Submit the following files to the assignment called `HW02` on Gradescope:

1. `Dates.java`
2. `ControlFlow.txt`
3. `Payments.java`
4. `README.txt`

Make sure to name these files exactly what we specify here. Otherwise,
our autograders might not work and we might have to take points off.
